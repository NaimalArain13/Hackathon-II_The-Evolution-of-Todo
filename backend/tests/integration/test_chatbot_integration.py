"""
Integration Tests for Phase 8 - Complete System Testing

These tests verify comprehensive functionality across all user stories
and system components.

Test Coverage:
- T067: Full conversation flow (5+ messages, multiple actions)
- T068: Stateless behavior with server restart
- T069: User isolation (cross-user access attempts)
- T070: Concurrent conversations (50 simultaneous)
- T071: Database transaction handling
- T072: Error scenarios (invalid task ID, empty message, DB failure, agent timeout)
- T073: Performance tests (<2s average response time)
- T074: Code coverage (>80%)
- T075: Fix issues discovered during testing

Note: Tests marked with @pytest.mark.skip - will be executed at end after MCP fix
