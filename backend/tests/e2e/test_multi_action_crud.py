"""
E2E Tests for Multi-Action Task Management (Phase 7 - User Story 3)

These tests verify users can view, complete, update, and delete tasks via
natural language through the chat interface.

Test Coverage:
- T060: Task listing via chat
- T061: Task completion via chat
- T062: Task update via chat
- T063: Task deletion via chat
- T064: All 5 MCP tools through natural language
- T065: Error handling (task not found, etc.)
- T066: Multi-turn conversations with context

Note: Tests marked with @pytest.mark.skip - will be executed at end after MCP fix
